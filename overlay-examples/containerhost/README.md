# Container Host Image

This is an example overlay description to produce a golden image that includes the [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/)
software to manage containers run through Podman in the machine. This is essentially a basic
developer-centric image for working with containers.

For more information on how to produce an image from this overlay description, see the README
for the directory above this one.
